      <p>
        One exception may be communication to a group that you are trying to influence for the best interest of your
        company and target market. An example of this is lobbying government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Define what your public or target is in your public relations effort. This is best done by defining your target
        market and then any sub-segment. Lining up publications and broadcasts with the market and the segments will
        define what the public is for your public relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bottom line is to get word out about you, your company, your products and services to those who could
        potentially buy from you. Public relations are just one part of marketing, as marketing is made up of many
        things. The good news about PR is the cost and the effectiveness when itâ€™s in front of your target market.

        <strong>Top 5 Reasons Companies Need Public Relations or Media Relations</strong> <br>
        Social media PR what used to be a need for a televised broadcast, newspaper coverage, or radio time in order to
        get coverage has since evolved into an internet-induced cloud of online branding. Media relations used to be
        simpler. Getting in touch with an intrigued journalist resulted in an article or broadcasting an announcement
        over the radio got results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Present day, these traditional methods are not only less effective, but more expensive. Print publications are
        only in vogue for as long as they are on shelves. While most newspapers of today are posting stories online in
        addition to print, the newest form of an endless shelf life advertisement is through internet visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online media is the replacement of traditional media and is now the standard media for Generation Z (those born
        in 2003 or after). Search engine optimization, content publishing, social media releases and podcasts are just
        some of the contemporary forms replacing newspapers, radio slots, and even T.V. ads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of these expanding outlets, traditional methods have and are expected to decline. This is why public
        relations is growing and becoming the newest form of marketing and promotion. Itâ€™s no longer about just
        getting your name out there; itâ€™s also about serving a purpose. Reaching customers and audiences in subtle yet
        effective ways is the latest trend in company exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are five specific examples of why public and media relations are a necessary component of a successful
        business or corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Developing a Brand or Image</strong> <br>
        Effective PR creates an image of a company, influences an audience that this image is good, and connects with
        consumers to create a relationship between company and customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a good image evolves from a combination of enacting corporate social responsibility, having excellent
        customer service, and maintaining a consistency in core messages. Your brand should be able to create a
        conversation with customers. Not only should a logo or company name be recognizable, but it should stand for
        something. Compare Disney to Busch Gardens, what do you think of each?
      </p>
      <p>
        One is family oriented while the other promotes wildlife and thrill rides. While each is in the same industry,
        they each have their own unique brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Making Partnerships</strong> <br>
        To keep a business growing, it must expand its endeavors and utilize its resources. Establishing a partnership
        is a huge move for business owners, and it comes from connections. That’s where public and media relations steps
        in.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key skills sets any PR professional should have is an ability to make and keep connections.
        Connections turn into opportunities at the drop of a hat, and it may not always come from a familiar face.
        Having representatives for companies at networking events is where partnerships happen. Partnerships evolve
        through many different forms, but almost always end up being beneficial for both parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Searchable Online Presence</strong> <br>
        These days when we want more information on a subject, chances are we Google it. If we want to know the recipe
        for a Thanksgiving tradition or the type of wine to use for a pot roast, it takes but a few seconds to bring up
        multiple different recipes from multiple different places. All this information is available at our finger tips,
        but what good is it if it’s not organized, reliable, and up-to-date?
      </p>
      <p>
        Search Engine Optimization is the secret behind successful websites. One of the most effective, yet privy
        tactics of public relations is making sure the content a business wants seen is showing up on the screen of the
        searcher. If a local cupcake bakery wants to establish themselves into the Tampa area, they better hope that its
        website pops up if someone Googles Tampa cupcake shops. Otherwise, they’ll go unknown. This is where a lot of
        potential exposure goes unseen and that’s where PR comes in to gain it back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Keeping the Tradition Alive</strong> <br>
        Although the internet has revolutionized the ways in which information is shared, traditional methods of public
        and media relations are still in use today and do still get results. Getting coverage through a newspaper
        article or landing a slot on a local nightly news broadcast will still provide visibility and can even produce a
        specified audience. These methods reach audiences that may not surf the internet often and instead rely on
        traditional media to get their news. Exposure is the greatest selling technique. However, the ultimate problem
        with exposure today is that there are thousands, if not millions, of options being thrown in our direction on a
        daily basis. It’s difficult to make your companyâ€™s advertisement stand out on a page filled with other ads.
        The average television show caters a third of its air time being set aside for advertisement. (You’re really
        only watching 22 minutes or 44 minutes of your favorite show) Even changing the radio station during commercials
        has become effortless with the button being located right on the steering wheel. Effective media and public
        relations mingle these traditional methods with current day trends. By creating content thatâ€™s usable and
        promotable on all platforms, efficient exposure is created.
