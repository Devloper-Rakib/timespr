                <strong>Keeping the Tradition Alive</strong> <br>
                Although the internet has revolutionized the ways in which information is shared, traditional methods of
                public and media relations are still in use today and do still get results. Getting coverage through a
                newspaper article or landing a slot on a local nightly news broadcast will still provide visibility and
                can even produce a specified audience.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Public Relations News, Public relations are the management function which evaluates public
                attitudes, identifies the policies and procedures of an individual or an organization with the public
                interest, and plans and executes a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance.â€
                While the public part implies inclusion of things like public affairs, community relations, investor
                relations, public press conferences, media events, internal communications and crisis communications, it
                also involves a lot of behind-the-scenes, non-public activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                It could involve simply the writing of a press release, but it could also involve coordinating media
                contacts for an event or conference, securing credentials, lobbying for article placement and the like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes public relations are an effort to influence the public. This is especially true for political
                action groups, associations and other groups. Sometimes public relations are community relations. Just
                look around your own community to see how many companies and organizations have a community affairs
                initiative or a person in charge with a related title.
            </p>
            <p>
                In larger, publicly held firms, this person is sometimes the director of investor relations. Investors
                are a public entity, so in this case public relations are appropriate. What the public wants to hear is
                a good story. Good PR is the telling of a good story. The better the story, the better the acceptance by
                the public and the better the public relations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course if the story is especially appealing to those that could be your clients, then you could have
                a PR homerun. In this case, it is communication with your target market that may or may not be very
                public.
            </p>
            <p>
                PRâ€™s importance is changing, according to The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR (Harper
                Business). American marketing strategists Al and Laura Ries argue that public relations has become the
                most effective way to build a brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well-known brands like The Body Shop, PlayStation and Harry Potter spend little on brand-name
                advertising. The same is true for many entrepreneurial companies like yours. Business owners become
                known in their respective fields of concentration many times through public relations and the associated
                media generated. PR is communication in many ways with your target market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe instead of public relations we ought to call it target market relations or TMR. You may be
                communicating about a new product, spreading news about your company or making a major announcement. You
                want to communicate publicly, but the only people you care about are potential prospects, customers or
                investors, in the case of a partnership or a public company.
            </p>
            <p>
                One exception may be communication to a group that you are trying to influence for the best interest of
                your company and target market. An example of this is lobbying government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Define what your public or target is in your public relations effort. This is best done by defining your
                target market and then any sub-segment. Lining up publications and broadcasts with the market and the
                segments will define what the public is for your public relations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bottom line is to get word out about you, your company, your products and services to those who
                could potentially buy from you. Public relations are just one part of marketing, as marketing is made up
                of many things. The good news about PR is the cost and the effectiveness when itâ€™s in front of your
                target market.

                <strong>Top 5 Reasons Companies Need Public Relations or Media Relations</strong> <br>
                Social media PR what used to be a need for a televised broadcast, newspaper coverage, or radio time in
                order to get coverage has since evolved into an internet-induced cloud of online branding. Media
                relations used to be simpler. Getting in touch with an intrigued journalist resulted in an article or
                broadcasting an announcement over the radio got results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Present day, these traditional methods are not only less effective, but more expensive. Print
                publications are only in vogue for as long as they are on shelves. While most newspapers of today are
                posting stories online in addition to print, the newest form of an endless shelf life advertisement is
                through internet visibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online media is the replacement of traditional media and is now the standard media for Generation Z
                (those born in 2003 or after). Search engine optimization, content publishing, social media releases and
                podcasts are just some of the contemporary forms replacing newspapers, radio slots, and even T.V. ads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of these expanding outlets, traditional methods have and are expected to decline. This is why
                public relations is growing and becoming the newest form of marketing and promotion. Itâ€™s no longer
                about just getting your name out there; itâ€™s also about serving a purpose. Reaching customers and
                audiences in subtle yet effective ways is the latest trend in company exposure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are five specific examples of why public and media relations are a necessary component of a
                successful business or corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Developing a Brand or Image</strong> <br>
                Effective PR creates an image of a company, influences an audience that this image is good, and connects
                with consumers to create a relationship between company and customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a good image evolves from a combination of enacting corporate social responsibility, having
                excellent customer service, and maintaining a consistency in core messages. Your brand should be able to
                create a conversation with customers. Not only should a logo or company name be recognizable, but it
                should stand for something. Compare Disney to Busch Gardens, what do you think of each?
            </p>
            <p>
                One is family oriented while the other promotes wildlife and thrill rides. While each is in the same
                industry, they each have their own unique brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Making Partnerships</strong> <br>
                To keep a business growing, it must expand its endeavors and utilize its resources. Establishing a
                partnership is a huge move for business owners, and it comes from connections. That’s where public and
                media relations steps in.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key skills sets any PR professional should have is an ability to make and keep connections.
                Connections turn into opportunities at the drop of a hat, and it may not always come from a familiar
                face. Having representatives for companies at networking events is where partnerships happen.
                Partnerships evolve through many different forms, but almost always end up being beneficial for both
                parties involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Searchable Online Presence</strong> <br>
                These days when we want more information on a subject, chances are we Google it. If we want to know the
                recipe for a Thanksgiving tradition or the type of wine to use for a pot roast, it takes but a few
                seconds to bring up multiple different recipes from multiple different places. All this information is
                available at our finger tips, but what good is it if it’s not organized, reliable, and up-to-date?
            </p>
            <p>
                Search Engine Optimization is the secret behind successful websites. One of the most effective, yet
                privy tactics of public relations is making sure the content a business wants seen is showing up on the
                screen of the searcher. If a local cupcake bakery wants to establish themselves into the Tampa area,
                they better hope that its website pops up if someone Googles Tampa cupcake shops. Otherwise, they’ll go
                unknown. This is where a lot of potential exposure goes unseen and that’s where PR comes in to gain it
                back.
